Fix DNS settings for Global Protect on MacOS

# Summary
When using Palo Alto Global Protect VPN sometimes the DNS settings don't let you use your own DNS while connected. This script fixes this behavior by overriding this with Google DNS (8.8.8.8).

# Usage
- First chmod +x fixDNS.sh

- Execute it! ./fixDNS.sh
